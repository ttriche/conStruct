\title{Convert a dataset from STRUCTURE to conStruct format}
\usage{
structure2conStruct(infile, onerowperind, start.loci, missing.datum,
  outfile)
}
\arguments{
\item{infile}{The name and path of the file in STRUCTURE format 
to be converted to \code{conStruct} format.}

\item{onerowperind}{Indicates whether the file format has 
one row per individual (\code{TRUE}) or two rows per 
individual (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{start.loci}{The index of the first column in the dataset 
that contains genotype data.}

\item{missing.datum}{The character or value used to denote 
missing data in the STRUCTURE dataset (often 0 or -9).}

\item{outfile}{The name and path of the file containing the 
\code{conStruct} formatted dataset to be generated 
    by this function.}
}
\value{
This function returns an allele frequency data matrix 
	that can be used as the \code{freqs} argument in a conStruct 
	analysis run using \code{\link{conStruct}}.  It also saves 
	this object as an .RData file so that it can be used in 
	future analyses.

\description{
\code{structure2conStruct} converts a STRUCTURE dataset 
to conStruct format
}
\details{
This function takes a population genetics dataset in 
STRUCTURE format and converts it to conStruct format. 
The STRUCTURE file can have one row per individual 
and two columns per locus, or one column and two rows 
per individual. It can only contain bi-allelic SNPs.
Missing data is acceptable, but must be indicated with 
a single value throughout the dataset.

This function takes a STRUCTURE format data file and 
	converts it to a \code{conStruct} format data file.
	This function can only be applied to diploid organisms.
	The STRUCTURE data file must be a plain text file, 
	and the data must start on the first line of the file, 
	with no column headers or extraneous text before the data 
	starts (if present, these extra lines should be deleted by hand).
	
		The STRUCTURE dataset can either be in the ONEROWPERIND=1 
		file format, with one row per individual and two columns 
		per locus, or the ONEROWPERIND=0 format, with two rows and 
	one column per individual. The first column of the STRUCTURE 
		dataset should be individual names. There may be any number 
		of other columns that contain non-genotype information before 
	the first column that contains genotype data, but there can 
		be no extraneous columns at the end of the dataset, after the 
		genotype data.
	
	The genotype data must be bi-allelic 
	single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Applying this function 
	to datasets with more than two alleles per locus may result in 
	cryptic failure. For more details, see the \code{format-data} 
	vignette.
