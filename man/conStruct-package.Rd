\title{The 'conStruct' package.}
\description{
A method for modeling genetic data as a combination of discrete
   layers, within each of which relatedness may decay continuously with geographic
   distance. This package contains code for running analyses (which are implemented
   in the modeling language 'rstan') and visualizing and interpreting output. See the
   associated paper for more details on the model and its utility.
